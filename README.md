Iâ€™ve just created a repository called xss-tags-cheatsheets. It contains various HTML tags that help inject our payloads. 
The name "xss-tags" might seem a bit random, but I chose it casually to indicate that it (html tags) includes XSS scripts for injection. 
HTML tags play a crucial role in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
